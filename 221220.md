### 韩非子

初见秦

臣敢言之: 往者齐南破荆, 东破宋, 西服秦, 北破燕, 中使韩魏, 土地广而兵强, 战克攻取, 诏令天下. 齐之清济浊河, 足以为限；长城巨防, 足以为塞. 齐, 五战之国也, 一战不克而无齐. 由此观之, 夫战者, 万乘之存亡也. 且闻之曰: "削迹无遗根, 无与祸邻, 祸乃不存." 秦与荆人战, 大破荆, 袭郢, 取洞庭, 五湖, 江南, 荆王君臣亡走, 东服于陈. 当此时也, 随荆以兵, 则荆可举；荆可举, 则民足贪也, 地足利也, 东以弱齐燕, 中以凌三晋. 然则是一举而霸王之名可成也, 四邻诸侯可朝也, 而谋臣不为, 引军而退, 复与荆人为和. 令荆人得收亡国, 聚散民, 立社稷主, 置宗庙, 令率天下西面以与秦为难. 此固以失霸王之道一矣. 天下又比周而军华下, 大王以诏破之, 兵至梁郭下. 围梁数旬, 则梁可拔；拔梁, 则魏可举；举魏, 则荆赵之意绝；荆赵之意绝, 则赵危；赵危而荆狐疑；东以弱齐燕, 中以凌三晋. 然则是一举而霸王之名可成也, 四邻诸侯可朝也, 而谋臣不为, 引军而退, 复与魏氏为和. 令魏氏反收亡国, 聚散民, 立社稷主, 置宗庙, 令率天下西面以与秦为难. 此固以失霸王之道二矣. 前者穰侯之治秦也, 用一国之兵而欲以成两国之功, 是故兵终身暴露于外, 士民疲病于内, 霸王之名不成. 此固以失霸王之道三矣.
