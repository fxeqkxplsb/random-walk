## 汉语

### 韩非子

臣闻: 天下阴燕阳魏, 连荆固齐, 收韩而成从{纵}, 将西面以与秦强为难. 臣窃笑之. 世有三亡, 而天下得之, 其此之谓乎! 臣闻之曰: "以乱攻治者亡, 以邪攻正者亡, 以逆攻顺者亡". 今天下之府库不盈, 囷仓空虚, 悉其士民, 张军数十百万, 其顿首戴羽为将军断死于前不至{止}千人, 皆以言死. 白刃在前, 斧锧在后, 而却走不能死也, 非其士民不能死也, 上不能故也. 言赏则不与, 言罚则不行, 赏罚不信, 故士民不死也. 今秦出号令而行赏罚, 有功无功相事也. 出其父母怀衽之中, 生未尝见寇耳. 闻战, 顿足徒裼, 犯白刃, 蹈炉炭, 断死于前者皆是也. 夫断死与断生者不同, 而民为之者, 是贵奋死也. 夫一人奋死可以对十, 十可以对百, 百可以千, 千可以对万, 万可以克天下矣. 今秦地折长补短, 方数千里, 名师数十百万. 秦之号令赏罚, 地形利害, 天下莫若也. 以此与{举}天下, 天下不足兼而有也. 是故秦战未尝不克, 攻未尝不取, 所当未尝不破, 开地数千里, 此其大功也. 然而兵甲顿, 士民病, 蓄积索, 田畴荒, 囷仓虚, 四邻诸侯不服, 霸王之名不成. 此无异故, 其谋臣皆不尽其忠也.
