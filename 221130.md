## 汉语

### 唐诗

望岳

杜甫

岱宗夫如何, 齐鲁青未了.
造化钟神秀, 阴阳割昏晓.
荡胸生层云, 决眦入归鸟.
会当凌绝顶, 一览众山小.

赠卫八处士

杜甫

人生不相见, 动如参与商.
今夕复何夕, 共此灯烛光.
少壮能几时, 鬓发各已苍.
访旧半为鬼, 惊呼热中肠.
焉知二十载, 重上君子堂.
昔别君未婚, 儿女忽成行.
怡然敬父执, 问我来何方.
问答未及已, 儿女罗酒浆.
夜雨剪春韭, 新炊间黄粱.
主称会面难, 一举累十觞.
十觞亦不醉, 感子故意长.
明日隔山岳, 世事两茫茫.

### 宋词

燕山亭 北行见杏花

赵佶

裁剪冰绡, 轻叠数重, 淡著胭脂匀注. 新样靓妆, 艳溢香融, 羞杀蕊珠宫女.易得凋零, 更多少无情风雨. 愁苦. 问院落凄凉, 几番春暮.
凭寄离恨重重, 这双燕, 何曾会人言语. 天遥地远, 万水千山, 知他故宫何处. 怎不思量, 除梦里有时曾去. 无据. 和梦也新来不做.
